# Sarcopenia-Identifier

A machine learning application that predicts individual risk of sarcopenia using 6-DOF (six degrees of freedom) gait parameters and provides personalized health recommendations.

## Overview

This application analyzes gait data to assess sarcopenia risk and delivers customized training and nutrition guidance based on the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia (AWGS) guidelines.

## Features

- **Sarcopenia Risk Prediction**: Utilizes 6-DOF gait parameters to calculate individual sarcopenia risk scores
- **Gait Data Analysis**: Processes Excel files containing preprocessed gait data from Optimum
- **Personalized Recommendations**: 
  - Daily training exercises tailored to individual needs
  - Nutrition plans based on AWGS guidelines
- **Evidence-Based Approach**: Follows established Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia standards

## Requirements

- Excel file with preprocessed gait data from Optimum

## Usage

1. Prepare your gait data Excel file using Optimum preprocessing
2. Upload the file to the application
3. Review the sarcopenia risk assessment
4. Access personalized training and nutrition recommendations

## About Sarcopenia

Sarcopenia is a progressive skeletal muscle disorder characterized by the loss of muscle mass and function. Early detection and intervention through proper exercise and nutrition can significantly improve outcomes.
